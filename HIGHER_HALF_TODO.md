# Higher Half Kernel Implementation TODO

This document outlines all the necessary changes to transition the kernel from lower memory (1MB) to higher half (3GB+). The implementation should be done in a way that maintains system stability throughout the process.

## Memory Layout Changes

### Linker Script (`linker.ld`)
- [ ] Change base address from 1M to `KERNEL_VIRTUAL_BASE` (0xC0000000)
- [ ] Add sections to store physical addresses for relocation:
  - [ ] `_kernel_physical_start` = 1M
  - [ ] `_kernel_physical_end` 
- [ ] Ensure all sections (.text, .rodata, .data, .bss) are properly aligned to 4KB boundaries
- [ ] Keep entry point at `_start` but ensure it's at virtual address 0xC0000000 + offset

### Kernel Layout Header (`include/kernel/kernel_layout.h`)
- [ ] Already has `KERNEL_VIRTUAL_BASE` set to 0xC0000000 - no change needed
- [ ] Verify `HEAP_VIRTUAL_START` (0xD0000000) is in higher half - looks correct
- [ ] Ensure all address definitions are consistent with higher half

## Boot Process Changes

### Higher Half Entry (`arch/i386/boot.s`)
- [ ] Create new assembly file `arch/i386/higher_half_entry.s` that:
  - [ ] Sets up temporary page directory for higher half mapping
  - [ ] Identity maps first 4MB (0x0 - 0x400000)
  - [ ] Maps physical 1MB-4MB to virtual 0xC0000000-0xC0300000
  - [ ] Loads page directory and enables paging
  - [ ] Jumps to higher half entry point (`_start_higher_half`)
- [ ] Add multiboot header to new entry file
- [ ] Update linker script to include this in first 8KB

### Kernel Entry Point (`kernel/kernel.c`)
- [ ] Update `kernel_main()` to work with virtual addressing
- [ ] Verify all global variables are properly addressed
- [ ] Ensure stack works correctly in higher half (currently set up in boot.s)

## Virtual Memory Manager (`arch/i386/vmm.c`)

### Page Directory Setup
- [ ] Create function to set up higher half page directory:
  - [ ] Identity map first 4MB (0x0 - 0x400000) for early boot
  - [ ] Map kernel physical address range to virtual 0xC0000000+
  - [ ] Set up proper flags for kernel pages (present, read/write)
- [ ] Modify `vmm_init()` to use higher half page directory
- [ ] Update `load_page_directory()` call with correct physical address

### Address Translation
- [ ] Update `vmm_map_page()` to handle physical to virtual translations
- [ ] Update `vmm_get_physical_addr()` to work with higher half addresses
- [ ] Update `vmm_unmap_page()` to work with higher half addresses
- [ ] Update `vmm_identity_map_page()` to work correctly

## Physical Memory Manager (`arch/i386/pmm.c`)
- [ ] Ensure `pmm_init()` correctly identifies available memory above 1MB
- [ ] Update `pmm_alloc_block()` to work with new memory layout
- [ ] Verify bitmaps and block tracking work with higher addresses

## Critical System Components

### GDT/IDT
- [ ] Ensure GDT is accessible in higher half (may need remapping)
- [ ] Update IDT to work with new memory layout
- [ ] Verify interrupt handlers work after transition

### Heap (`kernel/heap.c`)
- [ ] Update `heap_init()` to use higher half virtual addresses
- [ ] Verify `HEAP_VIRTUAL_START` (0xD0000000) is in higher half - looks correct
- [ ] Test heap allocation/deallocation after transition
- [ ] Update any physical address assumptions in heap functions

### Terminal/Framebuffer (`drivers/terminal.c`, `drivers/framebuffer_console.c`)
- [ ] Ensure terminal functions work with new memory layout
- [ ] Verify framebuffer is properly mapped (vmm_init already handles this)
- [ ] Test text output after transition

## Device Drivers

### PIC (`arch/i386/pic.c`)
- [ ] Verify PIC remapping works in higher half
- [ ] Test interrupt delivery after transition

### Keyboard (`drivers/keyboard.c`)
- [ ] Ensure keyboard handler works with new memory layout
- [ ] Verify keyboard buffer access after transition

### Mouse (`drivers/mouse.c`)
- [ ] Ensure mouse handler works with new memory layout
- [ ] Verify mouse event processing after transition

## Debug/Monitor Functions

### Debug Output
- [ ] Verify all debug functions work after transition
- [ ] Ensure `terminal_writestring()` and variants work properly
- [ ] Test debug output throughout boot process

## Testing Strategy

### Phased Implementation
1. [ ] Implement higher half mapping but continue running in lower memory
   - [ ] Set up page tables but don't enable paging yet
   - [ ] Add verification code to check mappings
2. [ ] Enable paging but keep low mappings for fallback
   - [ ] Jump to higher half but keep identity mapping
   - [ ] Test basic functionality
3. [ ] Remove low memory dependencies and run entirely in higher half
   - [ ] Remove identity mapping of low memory
   - [ ] Final testing

### Verification Points
- [ ] Memory allocation tests
- [ ] Interrupt handling tests
- [ ] Device driver functionality tests
- [ ] Heap management tests
- [ ] Address translation verification

## Files to Modify

### Core Files
- [ ] `linker.ld` - Memory layout and entry point
- [ ] `arch/i386/boot.s` - Early boot setup (may need modifications)
- [ ] Create `arch/i386/higher_half_entry.s` - Higher half entry point
- [ ] `kernel/kernel.c` - Main kernel entry and initialization
- [ ] `arch/i386/vmm.c` - Virtual memory manager
- [ ] `arch/i386/pmm.c` - Physical memory manager

### Configuration Headers
- [ ] `include/kernel/kernel_layout.h` - Already has correct definitions
- [ ] `include/arch/i386/vmm.h` - Update virtual memory constants if needed
- [ ] `include/arch/i386/pmm.h` - Update physical memory constants if needed

### Driver Files
- [ ] `drivers/terminal.c` - Terminal output
- [ ] `arch/i386/idt.c` - Interrupt descriptor table
- [ ] `arch/i386/gdt.c` - Global descriptor table
- [ ] `arch/i386/pic.c` - PIC initialization
- [ ] `drivers/keyboard.c` - Keyboard driver
- [ ] `drivers/mouse.c` - Mouse driver

## Constants to Update

### Memory Addresses
- [ ] `KERNEL_VIRTUAL_BASE` - Already 0xC0000000 (correct)
- [ ] `HEAP_VIRTUAL_START` - Already 0xD0000000 (correct)
- [ ] `HEAP_SIZE` - 0x100000 (1MB) - Ensure it fits in higher half
- [ ] Stack definitions - Ensure proper placement in higher half

### Page Table Entries
- [ ] No hardcoded physical addresses found - good practice
- [ ] Ensure page directory indices are correct for higher half

## Risk Mitigation

### Fallback Strategy
- [ ] Maintain ability to boot in lower memory if needed during development
- [ ] Implement panic handlers that work in both address spaces
- [ ] Keep serial debug output working throughout transition

### Verification Code
- [ ] Add memory layout validation functions
- [ ] Implement address translation verification
- [ ] Create boot stage reporting mechanism

## Post-Implementation Cleanup

### Remove Temporary Code
- [ ] Clean up identity mapping of first 1MB after transition is stable
- [ ] Remove any transitional address handling code
- [ ] Optimize page table usage

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Review memory access patterns
- [ ] Optimize virtual to physical address translation
- [ ] Ensure cache efficiency with new layout

## Dependencies for Future Features

### Process Management
- [ ] Memory layout must support user space separation
- [ ] Virtual memory management must handle multiple address spaces
- [ ] Context switching requires stable kernel addressing

### User Mode
- [ ] Proper privilege level transitions
- [ ] Memory protection between kernel and user space
- [ ] System call interface implementation

This checklist should be completed in order, with thorough testing at each major step to ensure system stability.
